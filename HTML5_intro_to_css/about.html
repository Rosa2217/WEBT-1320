            <h1>The Enduring Legacy of The Hunger Games</h1>
            <p>Since the release of The Hunger Games trilogy, both the books and the films have captured the imaginations of millions worldwide. The series sparked important conversations about power, media manipulation, and the resilience of the human spirit. Katniss Everdeen's story of survival, sacrifice, and rebellion has inspired generations to challenge injustice in all its forms. In addition to its cultural impact, the series has helped redefine the young adult genre, influencing books and films that followed. It continues to inspire fans, cosplayers, and activists who see Katniss as a symbol of resistance and hope. Although The Hunger Games is just a book and film, it does a great job capturing just how similar the Capitol is to the real life we live in. </p>

            <h3>Themes of The Hunger Games</h3>
            <p>The Hunger Games have several themes throught the movie, and one of them is survival. When the games begin the tributes have to fight constanlty to stay alive. Not only do we see survival in the games, but in District 12 as well. District 12 is the poorest District and the people there have to figure out how to eat and how to stay alive as well. Another theme is power and control, which the games themselves reflect real-world struggles for power and authority. Doing the games every year is a way the Capitol shows thier power to the Districts. Rebellion and resistance is another theme that shows that even the smallest spark can challenge tyranny. Lastly, sacrifice and humanity is shown when the story underscores the cost of standing up for what's right.</p>
