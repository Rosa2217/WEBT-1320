                <p>In a future where North America is divided into 12 districts and are controlled by a powerful and oppressive government. Every year, the Capitol demands a cruel tribute from each district—a boy and a girl, known as “tributes”—to fight in the annual Hunger Games.The series follows Katniss Everdeen, a young woman from District 12, who volunteers to take her sister Prim's place in the games. What begins as a fight for survival turns into a spark of rebellion that threatens to ignite a revolution across Panem. As alliances are forged, enemies are made, and Katniss grapples with her role as the face of resistance, the story explores themes of power, sacrifice, and the cost of rebellion. The Hunger Games is just the start of how the rebellion begins, and how Katniss becomes thier Mockingjay.</p>

                <p>Each year, The Hunger Games take place in a specially designed arena—an environment crafted by the Capitol to test the tributes survival skills. The arena can take on many forms, from forests to deserts, and even dangerous urban landscapes. Every aspect of the arena is manipulated by the Capitol, including the weather, hazards, and resources, to ensure the Games are as thrilling and brutal as possible for the Capitols entertainment. In the first movie the arena that the tributes fight in is a forest with fireballs, wild animals, poisonous plants, and man made traps set by the gamemakers. The arenas were also considered important historical landmarks and were popular tourist destinations for many Capitol citizens. The reason for this was because the Capitol citizens wanted to rewatch the game and visit the tribute's deaths.</p>
